{/*
    The WIX_STORES_APP_ID is a constant used to identify the Wix store application
    when making API requests, specifically when adding a product to the cart. 
    In this case, the ID is likely a shared or static value for all Wix stores, 
    which is why it is safe to keep it as a hardcoded constant 
    Since it does not change and is not specific to any single store, 
    
    there's no need to hide it in .env files.
